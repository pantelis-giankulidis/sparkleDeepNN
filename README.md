# Sparkle Deep Neural Network
A simple implementation of a deep neural network generating people's names. The network has been created with pytorch and has been train with the 32033 real people's names in the data/names.txt file.
It supports adjustable word embeddings and can generate the next character on them, leading to unique combinations that look like real names!
